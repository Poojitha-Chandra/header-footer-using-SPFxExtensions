SPFx extensions allows you to extend SharePoint user experience, where you can customize your header, footer, toolbar, notifications etc. within the Modern pages for the Client-side development.

- Application Customizer
- Field Customizer
- Command sets

In this repository,I had built the customized header and footer using Application Customizer.
